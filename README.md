## DATA690-WANG
In this repository, for professor Wang's Data 690 course, a portfolio of my assignments, projects, and personal practice can 
be found. 
A strong focus will be directed towards global median and mean incomes of citizens in different countries throughout the world. CSV files obtained through https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.ADJ.NNTY.PC.CD will be analyzed to measure and visualize the different levels of average wealth. Elements contained within the CSV include:


 - **Name**(Nations Names)
 - **MedianHouseholdIncome**
 - **MedianPerCaptiaIncome**
 - **Pop2019**(The nations population)
